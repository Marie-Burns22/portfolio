									Software Engineer with strong communication skills from a twelve-year career in science education and a past life as a
									wildland firefighter. A curiosity about how the world works led me to software engineering and an inclination for new challenges prompted a career change. Problem solving, collaboration, and using code to increase efficiency, opportunity, and improve
									people’s daily lives are my career passions. I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Technical Project Introduction</h3>
									<p>My technical projects are inspired by friends, family, and students. In each project I identify what information the user needs and then design a web application to collect and organize that data.</p>

									<p>Each project was either designed to utilize a technology I was learning or was designed with the technologies that best suited the purpose of the application.</p>
									<p>Specific technologies used for each project are listed in the project descriptions below.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Vegas in Miami</h3>
											<h4 class="major">Small Business Website</h4>
											<p>This website was built for Ms. Vegas, former America's Got Talent contestant, and entrepreneur in Miami. It was designed to market her services, collect request for bookings, and allow her to create, update and delete information for the website. To meet the requirement of marketing services, I created a single page application with React that uses hooks, event handlers, and fetch requests to access information from an API backend. To allow Ms. Vegas to create, update, and delete the information, I built the API backend with Rails and used the ActiveAdmin gem to create an admin dashboard. ActiveAdmin handles the authentication and authorization to make sure the information is secure. Although we have now implemented a button to connect to Acuity for scheduling, I originally wrote a form so that clients could request specific bookings without having to create an account using the booking request forms. When a form was filled out for a specific appointment (available time-slots are added using the admin dashboard), on submit the form is emailed using formspree and also a fetch request is used to change the appoint status from available to requested.  The rails controller for the time-slots only render those that are available to prevent multiple clients from requesting the same time-slot. This feature can still be seen in the demo video. The Request Services form still serves as an example of a form that requests information from the API, but only triggers a formspree email without a post reqest to the API.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Debbie's CPR</h3>
											<h4 class="major">Small Business Website</h4>
												<ul>
													<li>Constructed Ruby on Rails backend API with ActiveAdmin dashboard to create, update, and delete information.</li>
													<li>Built application with React 16 utilizing classes, life cycle methods, event handlers, and fetch requests to access and
													update information from the API. Setup RESTful routes with React Router.</li>
													<li>Decreased load time by hosting React frontend on Netlify to access data from backend API on Heroku.</li>
												</ul>
												Debbie's CPR is a small business that uses the website for booking classes. It is transitioning from using google sites and forms for booking to using a third party booking and payment service. This new version of the website provides updated design along with an easy to use admin dashboard to make creating, editing, and deleting information on the website easier for the business owner. A form connected to form spree (emails the form information) replaces the use of personal phone number and email for communication to improve privacy and efficiency.</p>
